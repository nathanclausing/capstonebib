### Summary
This artlce gives an overview of the process of how humans hear

### Key Points
- Sound waves are collected by the outer ear and directed into the ear canal, where they cause the eardrum to vibrate.
- The vibrations of the eardrum are transmitted through three small bones in the middle ear, which amplify the sound and transmit it to the inner ear.
- The inner ear contains the cochlea, which is a spiral-shaped structure filled with fluid and lined with hair cells. The vibrations from the middle ear cause waves in the fluid of the cochlea, which cause the hair cells to bend.
- The bending of the hair cells triggers an electrical signal that is sent to the brain through the auditory nerve.
- The brain processes the electrical signals from the auditory nerve to create the perception of sound.
